# Minesweaper-in-C
a consol minesweaper.

A makefill has been added.


## To run the programm:
1.Open terminal where you cloned the project.

2.enter make

3.Now you can play with ./minesweaper {**number_of_Rows**} {**number_of_Columns**} {**number_of_Mines**}

Once the programm has been compiled you don't need to do step 1 and 2.
If you don't want the o files and still keep the game then moddify the makefile clean section by removing minesweaper and run make clean or do it manualy.

This is a school project and might be poor in performance, but I hope it will make fun
